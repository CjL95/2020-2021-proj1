			<p><b>Joeseph Mauma, a 35 year old Boulder, Colorado resident, is suing Jeffrey Warne, CEO of Marie Callendar's, for alleged false advertising following a large Amazon purchase he made last week.</b></p>
			<br/>
			<p class="content">
		    Marie Callendar's certainly makes no secret of its trade in delicious and convenient dinners. In fact, their name is almost synonymous with the industry. However, according to Mauma and his friends, it's not enough. In fact, they've began a movement in their town of Boulder. Wielding signs and calendars, they march through the streets of downtown, yelling phrases like "What day is it? We don't know!" We spoke to Mai Mauma, Joseph's wife, about her take on her husband's position. <blockquote><em>"Joe Mauma is crazy. That's why I married him. He's always in an uproar about something, and it can get grating at times, but he does it all with conviction, you know. It comes from a good place."</em></blockquote> Together with his faithful companions, Joe hopes that he can come to an agreement with the CEO. According to him, he lost $3,500 when he mistakenly ordered over a thousand microwave dinners, thinking he was purchasing wall calendars for the upcomming year. <q>I was expecting a few boxes, sure, but when 2 fridge trucks pulled up to my driveway, I was confused. When they began wheeling dinner after scrumptious dinner, I knew then that someone wronged me.</q>, he said in an interview late yesterday morning. We reached out to Warne, but he declined to comment. As of today, there has been no change to the situation. We will update this article with any additional information.</p>
